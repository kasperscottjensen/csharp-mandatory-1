In C#, { get; set; } is a shorthand syntax for defining properties that have both a getter and a setter method. This syntax creates an implicit private backing field for the property.

Here's an example of using the { get; set; } syntax to define a property:

csharp

public class Person
{
public string Name { get; set; }
}

In this example, the Name property has a public getter and setter method that allows external code to read and modify the value of the property. When you access the Name property, C# automatically generates the getter and setter methods and the private backing field that stores the value of the property.

On the other hand, proper getters and setters are explicitly defined methods that allow you to control how values are read from and written to the property. This gives you more control over how the property behaves and can allow you to enforce constraints or perform validation before allowing a value to be set.

Here's an example of using proper getters and setters to define a property:

csharp

public class Person
{
private string name;

public string Name
{
get { return name; }
set
{
if (value == null)
{
throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(value));
}

name = value;
}
}
}

In this example, the Name property has a private backing field named name, and the getter and setter methods are explicitly defined. The setter method checks whether the value being set is null and throws an exception if it is. This ensures that the Name property can never be set to null.

Overall, the { get; set; } syntax is more concise and easier to read, but proper getters and setters provide more control over how values are read from and written to a property.

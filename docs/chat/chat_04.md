To extract data from a list of lists based on an object attribute, you can use LINQ to query the data and filter the results.

Assuming you have a list of lists where each inner list contains objects of a particular class, and you want to extract all objects that have a specific attribute value, you can use the SelectMany() method to flatten the list of lists into a single list, and then use the Where() method to filter the results based on the attribute value.

Here's an example of how to extract all objects that have a specific Id attribute value from a list of lists:

csharp

public class MyObject
{
public int Id { get; set; }
public string Name { get; set; }
}

List<List<MyObject>> listOfLists = new List<List<MyObject>>
{
new List<MyObject> { new MyObject { Id = 1, Name = "Object 1" }, new MyObject { Id = 2, Name = "Object 2" } },
new List<MyObject> { new MyObject { Id = 3, Name = "Object 3" }, new MyObject { Id = 1, Name = "Object 4" } }
};

int targetId = 1;

List<MyObject> results = listOfLists.SelectMany(list => list).Where(obj => obj.Id == targetId).ToList();

foreach (MyObject obj in results)
{
Console.WriteLine(obj.Name);
}

In this example, we have a list of lists where each inner list contains MyObject instances. We want to extract all MyObject instances that have an Id attribute value of 1.

We use the SelectMany() method to flatten the list of lists into a single list of MyObject instances, and then we use the Where() method to filter the results based on the Id attribute value. The ToList() method is used to convert the filtered results to a new list.

Finally, we loop through the results and print the Name property of each MyObject instance that was filtered by the LINQ query.
